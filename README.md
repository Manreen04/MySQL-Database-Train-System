# MySQL-Database-Train-System
SQL Train Management System Database is used to store, organize, and manage all the data related to train operations using SQL (Structured Query Language). It helps railway companies keep track of everything in one place and make sure everything runs smoothly.
There are 3 files to construct the train system, creating tables, inserting data, and constructing functions.
There are 2 word files, Part A is the initial version and Part B is the updated version. Part A ERD is incorrect therefore Part B ERD made enhancements.
